                <p>Primary Leadership
                    DC students are encouraged to get involved in a practical, hands-on manner in the realities of school, and are helped to understand school “from the other side” – the side of offering opportunities and experiences to others, rather than just receiving them.

                    To achieve this, Doha College extends to Primary students a comprehensive range of leadership openings. Each year, elections and other selection mechanisms crystallise into an eager group of students that gladly put in the extra effort to benefit their peers and the school community.

                    The primary Head Boy and Head Girl attend various events as representatives of Doha College and at times are required to make public speeches. They serve as role models to students and act as liaison between the student body and the leadership group.


                    The participation in committees and leadership teams brings students skills that will serve them well in the future, such as public speaking, negotiating, organisational and team-work skills, problem-solving, conflict mediating, empathy and more.

                    In their positions of influent role models to younger peers, the student leaders are expected to:

                    act with care, courtesy and reliability
                    be positive and enthusiastic
                    listen, show empathy towards others and act as good friends would
                    use manners and good grace when dealing with students and adults
                    treat others fairly, honestly and protect their dignity
                    The other student leadership roles are:

                    School Councillors
                    Prefects
                    DC Lifestyles representatives
                    Eco Warriors
                    iChild
                    Charity Committee representatives
                    House Captains

                    Secondary Leadership (2019)
                    The secondary leaders or the "Big 6" put in extra hours representing Doha College at public events, acting as ambassadors of the school in the wider community, providing a link between the student body and the leadership group. They go through an arduous application process submitting written entries and speaking to student audiences about what they can bring to the roles, thereby polishing their leadership skills. For those elected, the tenure of such positions makes an excellent point of sale to highlight on their university applications.

                    The posts of head girl and head boy, their deputies and senior prefects are not only significant in terms of their responsibility, but these positions also carry an enormous amount of prestige. They are leaders, figureheads and role models for the rest of the school population and uphold the highest possible expectations for the College. Students can also become ambassadors and prefects of the House System.


                    Some of the goals of the Big 6 are to further the integration of all year groups, and maximize the efficiency of student leadership through smarter inter-committee communication. A few projects that achieve these goals are the ‘Buddy Programme’, where Year 7 students are partnered with 6th form students, the CCI Legacy Talks, which has grown to include students as young as Year 5, and a host of committees that take on various aspects of school life.

                    The other student led committees are:

                    Social Committee
                    Charities Committee
                    Student Council
                    Communications Committee
                    Ivybridge Committee
                    Digital Leaders
                    Environment Committee
                    Wellbeing Committee
                    Academic Support Committee
                    Yearbook Committee
                    Cultural Committee

Our team shares a passion for everything positive in sport. We believe in being inclusive and helping people to achieve whatever they want from getting involved, whether it’s professional coaching, team sports, getting fit, making friends, holiday sports camps or just a bit of fun. Evo Sports is here for everyone! Our members are at the heart of everything we do and we’re proud of the wonderful relationships that have grown over the years. Our values of professionalism, respect, friendship, inclusion, pride, integrity and excellence are the foundations of our organisation.

Amongst other achievements, we were delighted to be chosen as a case study to demonstrate the benefits of community sport, during Qatar’s FIFA World Cup 2022 bid. We were delighted to receive ‘Best Multi Sports Youth Coaching Company – Qatar 2019’ by GHP Fitness and nutrition awards. Since 2011 we’ve been based at Doha College, where we enjoy some of the country’s best sports facilities. Stay tuned for news about the world-class new sports centre opening later this year at the College! We look forward to welcoming you to Evo Sport, whatever your passion!

All our members are welcome to attend any Friends' meetings, where you will be given a warm welcome.
